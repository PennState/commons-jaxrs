  PAYMENT("payment", "Indicates a resource where payment is accepted.  This relation type registration did not indicate a reference. Requested by Joshua Kinberg and Robert Sayre. It is meant as a general way to facilitate acts of payment, and thus this specification makes no assumptions on the type of payment or transaction protocol. Examples may include a web page where donations are accepted or where goods and services are available for purchase. rel=\"payment\" is not intended to initiate an automated transaction. In Atom documents, a link element with a rel=\"payment\" attribute may exist at the feed/channel level and/or the entry/item level.
